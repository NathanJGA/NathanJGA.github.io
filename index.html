        <p style="font-size:150%; height:40%; width:40%; text-align:left; padding:0px 120px;">Hello I am Nathan Paul, 13 years old<br /> and I'm student from Olongapo City National High School.
        <p style="font-size:150%; height:40%; width:40%; text-align:left; padding:0px 120px;">
           Good day and this is my first webpage. This is a PT<br /> (Performance Task) that our teacher 
            asked us to do.<br /> At first, I had a hard time because I wasn't very good at<br /> such things, but 
            when my teacher said that I just enjoy<br /> making a webpage, I can say that creating a webpage<br /> 
            is like a game, at first you will have a hard time but<br /> eventually you will get used to it 
            as well.</p> 
        <p style="font-size:150%; height:40%; width:40%; text-align:left; padding:0px 120px;"> 
            Now that I have learned, I can be sure that I will intensify doing such things and will continue until I grow up.
